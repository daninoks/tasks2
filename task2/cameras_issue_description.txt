    Based on the available data, we can say with confidence that in highly
loaded locations, the maximum number of cameras connected to the filter is 1,
cause more then 1 camera will overload queue extremely fast. (2 cameras in 4s)


    However, assuming we know the camera parameters:
- lens width 35 mm
- sensor size 1/4 frame
- installed height 3 m
    We can conclude that the same person will be in the frame for at least 2
seconds, which means that in order not to overload the system, the check can
take place less than 1 in 2 seconds. This means that you can use up to
3 cameras connected to one filter.


    On the other hand, if we assume that the cameras are installed for
observation in sparsely populated places, technical passages or tunnels, as
well as not far from the entrances designed for low throughput
(avg <1 person per 5s per camera), then up to 4 cameras can be installed,
but not more so that data is not lost in the unlikely event that 5 people are
in 5 frames on 4 cameras in 5 seconds.
